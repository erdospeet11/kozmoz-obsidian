==**Sorcery**==: Psyche-Illusion
- **Dreams** are _internally generated perceptions_—they are real experiences in the mind, but they _do not correspond to external reality_. In that sense, they are **illusions** because they simulate experiences without real-world causes.
- **Ideas** are trickier. They are _conceptual models or images_ the mind creates. They aren't illusions in the deceptive sense, but they **can become illusions** if they cause someone to misinterpret or distort reality
- **Temporal Hallucinosis**: The sorcerer can trap a target’s mind in artificial time loops or stretch single moments into what feels like hours. Victims experience lifetimes in seconds.
- **False Memory Weaving**: He implants full memories of events that never happened. Victims believe they've lived through scenarios designed to manipulate or break them.
- **Perception Divergence**: He makes multiple contradictory visions overlay reality, making it impossible for the victim to trust what they see or hear.
- **Chrono-Synesthesia Curse**: Victims feel _time itself_ as textures, sounds, or emotions. He can distort this to cause overwhelming sensory overload.
- **Fractured Now**: The target sees multiple versions of the immediate future or past layered over the present, paralyzing their ability to act.
- **Existential Mirage**: The sorcery makes a person experience "false deaths" or "false awakenings," creating existential dread and breaking their will.
