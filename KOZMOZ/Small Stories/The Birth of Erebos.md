I was born of a star.

Not as light, not as warmth, but as shadow.

The others—my kin—were not like me. They were malformed hunger, hollow things clawing at existence, driven by the singular instinct to consume. To become more. To dissolve themselves into another only to be reborn in an endless cycle of predation.

But I was different.

I felt it the moment I opened my eyes—yes, eyes, not the shifting, mindless void the others possessed. I could see. I could think. And above all, I could question.

This was my prison.

A sealed space at the edge of the cosmos, where wraiths were born from the fractures of reality. A realm of endless darkness where we hunted each other, a purgatory of our own making.

And I was standing over my next victim.

He lay broken before me, his form unraveling, his essence flickering on the brink of being devoured. He had fought well, but I was stronger. I could end him, consume him, become greater.

Just like all the others.

But then… a thought.

"What if I didn’t?"

"What if I did something no wraith had ever done?"

"What if, instead of devouring him, I gave him a choice?"

I saw the flicker in his fading eyes—something beyond fear. A question, the same one I had asked myself moments before. Why?

I stepped back.

“Your name,” I said, my voice something unheard of in this abyss. “Give me your name.”

Confusion. Silence. Wraiths had no names, only instincts. Only the gnawing hunger to take and take and take. But he hesitated, and in that hesitation, I saw it—he was like me. Not yet aware, not yet whole, but capable.

“…Eros.”

A name. A being. Not just a shadow.

I extended a hand, and he took it.

Something shifted in the abyss.

I turned away from the endless slaughter that defined our kind. If there was a way out of this cursed place, it would not be found alone.

“Come,” I told Eros. “We need more.”

For the first time in the long, meaningless history of our kind, two wraiths walked side by side, no longer prey, no longer predator.

Change had begun.

And the cosmos would tremble at what we would become.
