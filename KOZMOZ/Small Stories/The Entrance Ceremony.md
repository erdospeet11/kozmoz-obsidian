-Welcome everyone! I am Elrique, the curator of this institution. You all have been invited to participated in the Youth Ascension Program. For 3 years, all of you will stay inside this building and recieve the most complex and cutting-edge education this world has to offer. Those of you who show promise and progress will be awarded.


Now, it is 8:00, so I ask you to enter the room on my left where instructors will explain around the complex, give your your schedule and place you in rooms.
