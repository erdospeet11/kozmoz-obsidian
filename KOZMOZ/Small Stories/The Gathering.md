The air was thick with anticipation as I stepped into the chamber. The others were already here—figures draped in celestial robes, their forms half-shadowed by the flickering light of the great orrery overhead. 

The constellations spun slowly in the void above us, casting a faint glow upon the long table where we sat, waiting.

But not for long.

The organizer was missing.

A murmur ran through the room. Whispers, speculation. Where was he? Why summon us only to delay his arrival? The atmosphere was taut, a string stretched to its limit, vibrating with unseen tension.

Then, the doors parted with a low groan.

entered. His presence alone silenced the room. His robes, once immaculate, were stained with dust from places beyond time. He strode forward, every step measured as if bracing himself for the weight of his own words.

He did not waste time.

“A calamity is upon us.”

The words hung heavy, pressing down on our chests. He scanned the faces around the table, searching for understanding.

“They are returning.”

A hushed silence.

“They are not alone.”

The great orrery shifted, the constellations rearranging themselves, revealing a vision: Wraiths, great cosmic horrors with endless, writhing limbs and eyes that burned like dying stars, crawling from the edges of existence. But they did not come of their own will. A force guided them. A force we had hoped never to see again.

A figure stepped forward. One of the Elders. “Who commands them?”
The organizer inhaled sharply. Then, without a word, he raised a hand. The room trembled. A crack split the air before us, revealing a vision of raw, impossible power. A presence beyond measure, a force both familiar and alien.

The figure in the vision moved, eyes like twin eclipses staring into our very souls.

Someone gasped.
“No… it cannot be.”

But it was.
The organizer lowered his hand, the vision dissolving into silence. Then he spoke, and his words were heavy with sorrow.
“He is my son.”
A shift in the room. A silent understanding passed between us. A brother to most. A traitor to all.
Another voice—low, almost unwilling—broke the silence.
“There were two.”
A deeper chill settled over the gathering. We had banished them both long ago, cast them beyond the known boundaries of the universe, and sealed them away so they could never return.
And yet, here we were.
“Their power has grown,” the organizer admitted. “They are not what they once were.”
A sense of finality settled over the chamber. There were no answers, only a growing darkness.
The meeting ended not with a resolution, but with silence. With questions.
And with the knowledge that the war we thought we had won was only ever a delay.
