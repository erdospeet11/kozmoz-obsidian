cosmic energy leaks through a cosmic entity, the pulsing heart. this energy makes an impact on the environment, people.

some people gets to control it or transform into monster

cosmic energy isn‚Äôt infinite. People **burn out** or **fade** if they push too far.

Let different cultures interpret the energy differently: science vs. mysticism vs. cult.

Use scientific language when describing early studies of The Pulse (quantum resonance, electromagnetic decay, gravitational anomalies).

people use it for
	- sorcery
	- martial arts
	- sword arts
in these respected fields people use some kind of strengthening to make them stronger temporarily with cosmic energy
	- Prowess: concetration of the body
	- Clarity: concentration of the mind
### üß† Realistic/Scientific Alternatives for _Sorcery_

**1. Astral Encoding**

> The user manipulates cosmic energy via mental algorithms‚Äîencoded patterns projected into space-time. Like programming reality.

**2. Quantum Invocation**

> ‚ÄúSpells‚Äù are actually precise quantum-state manipulations, causing shifts in local probability, entropy, or matter.

**3. Pulse Manipulation**

> A catch-all term‚Äîsimilar to ‚Äúmagic‚Äù but grounded in the manipulation of Pulse energy through concentration and geometry.

**6. Energetic Formulas / Astral Equations**

> Every ‚Äúspell‚Äù is a learned equation‚Äîsorcerers solve them through meditation, precise motion, or vocal resonance.

**7. Anomaly Engineering**

> The most hardcore sci-tech term. Users deliberately create controlled anomalies (micro black holes, time distortions, reality bleeds) as tools or weapons.

### üß™ Glossary Style Example:

> **Term:** _Astral Encoding_  
> **Definition:** The conscious act of embedding high-energy cosmic instructions into space-time via mental structuring and emotional resonance. Often performed using mudras (hand signs), vocal tones, or symbolic artifacts. Considered the scientific successor to ancient ‚Äúsorcery.‚Äù
