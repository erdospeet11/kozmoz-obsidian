Cosmic energy leaks through a cosmic entity, the Pulse. Energy waves soar through periodically that affect people and environment.
Some people gets to control it or transform into a monster

Different cultures in the early days interpret these phenomena differently: 
	science (quantum resonance, electromagnetic decay, gravitational anomalies)
	mysticism
	cult.

people use it for
	- sorcery
	- martial arts
	- sword arts
    cosmic energy isn’t infinite. People **burn out** or **fade** if they push too far.
in these respected fields people use some kind of strengthening to make them stronger temporarily with cosmic energy

| Discipline | Source              | Expression                                      | Example                              |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Prowess    | Body                | Physical Movement                               | Martial Arts                         |
| Clarity    | Mind                | Thought / Cognition                             | Sorcery                              |
| Dominion   | Will/External Focus | Control over tools, terrain, weapons, anomalies | Weapon Manipulation, Anomaly Bending |
### 1. **Dominion** ✅

- Implies control over **objects**, **space**, **external energy**, even **weapons** or **constructs**
    
- Can encompass **weapon styles**, **puppetry**, **territorial control**, and **field effects**
    
- Ideal for characters who manipulate the battlefield or fight through constructs
    

### 2. **Resonance**

- Focuses on **harmonics**, **frequency tuning**, and **energetic alignment** with cosmic objects or relics
    
- Perfect if you want a more **scientific, wave-based** interpretation
    

### 3. **Will** or **Intent**

- Leans into **raw determination**, allowing users to impose their **inner desire** onto reality—very anime
    
- Broad, but may be harder to mechanically define
    

### 4. **Essence**

- Taps into the **soul or spirit**, creating a system where unique essence types define one's path
    
- More mystical, spiritual flavor

## 🔷 Example: **Dominion as a Discipline**

### 🔹 Core Features:

- **Weapon Binding**: bond with a weapon (or multiple), unlock techniques via synergy
    
- **Object Channeling**: infuse tools or relics with Pulse energy
    
- **Environmental Control**: manipulate gravity, air pressure, terrain features
    
- **Construct Weaving**: summon and control cosmic constructs (drones, sentries, walls)
    

### 🔹 Weakness:

- Highly dependent on surroundings or tools—vulnerable when **stripped of gear** or in anti-energy zones
    

### 🔹 Visual Style:

- Cosmic chains, floating relics, glyph-covered weapons, orbiting constructs
Final Triangle Summary

|---|---|---|---|
|**Prowess**|Body|Self-enhancement|Brawlers, monks, physical cultivators|
|**Clarity**|Mind|Mental structuring of energy|Sorcerers, tacticians, Astral Encoders|
|**Dominion**|Will / External|Weapons, objects, constructs|Weapon masters, engineers, anomaly users|

### 🧠 Realistic/Scientific Alternatives for _Sorcery_

**1. Astral Encoding**
> The user manipulates cosmic energy via mental algorithms—encoded patterns projected into space-time. Like programming reality.

**2. Quantum Invocation**
> “Spells” are actually precise quantum-state manipulations, causing shifts in local probability, entropy, or matter.

**3. Pulse Manipulation**
> A catch-all term—similar to “magic” but grounded in the manipulation of Pulse energy through concentration and geometry.

**4. Energetic Formulas / Astral Equations**
> Every “spell” is a learned equation—sorcerers solve them through meditation, precise motion, or vocal resonance.

**7. Anomaly Engineering**
> The most hardcore sci-tech term. Users deliberately create controlled anomalies (micro black holes, time distortions, reality bleeds) as tools or weapons.

> **Term:** _Astral Encoding_  
> **Definition:** The conscious act of embedding high-energy cosmic instructions into space-time via mental structuring and emotional resonance. Often performed using mudras (hand signs), vocal tones, or symbolic artifacts. Considered the scientific successor to ancient “sorcery.”

> **Term:** Dimensional Syntax
>Spells are constructed like grammatically complete statements in a hyper-mathematical language that interacts with dimensional layers.



### 🔷 1. **Pulse Afflictions** (aka "Pulseborn Conditions")

Just like some gain power, others suffer **biological, mental, or dimensional deformities**. This gives room for **tragedy, body horror**, or enemies like:

- **Fractured:** People who absorbed too much cosmic energy and are now unstably phasing in and out of space-time.
    
- **Wretches:** Those who failed to control their transformation and now act as Pulse-corrupted monsters.
    
- **Stillborns:** People born after The Pulse with inert or fading lifeforce—immune to cosmic energy but also sterile or dying.
    

> These afflictions could be feared, studied, weaponized—or even **cured** via advanced sorcery or sacrifice.

### 🔷 3. **Energy Archetypes (Pulse Resonance Types)**

Cosmic energy could manifest in different "colors" or **frequencies** based on the individual or region. These aren’t elements, but **conceptual forces**. Each sorcerer has an **innate resonance** they attune to.

Examples:

- **Graviton Pulse** – gravity control, black hole generation, time dilation
    
- **Solar Pulse** – radiant heat, vision manipulation, solar flares
    
- **Liminal Pulse** – illusion, mind invasion, dreamwalking
    
- **Decay Pulse** – entropy control, aging acceleration, matter breakdown
    
- **Ancestral Pulse** – ties to ancient memories, genetic echoes, reincarnation rituals

### 🔷 4. **Cosmic Sigils / Glyphs**

To ground and stabilize cosmic energy, users may need to inscribe or visualize **Pulse glyphs**, possibly:

- Tattooed into their flesh (burned or inked)
    
- Worn as relics
    
- Drawn in the air before casting a technique
    

Glyphs add a **ritualistic + scientific** vibe—could even combine with **Astral Equations** in battle.

---

### 🔷 5. **The Fade Threshold**

Add a **visible indicator** (like a glowing vein pattern, eye color shift, aura intensity) to show how close someone is to **burnout or fading**. This creates tension in battle and narrative:

- Characters _approaching the threshold_ gain power, but risk death or transformation.
    
- Skilled users can hover near the edge and use the energy more efficiently—this becomes an **advanced technique** called _“Margin Wielding.”_

### 🔷 6. **Emotion as Catalyst**

Introduce **emotional resonance** as a multiplier or requirement. Similar to _Clarity_, but deeper:

- **Fear** boosts survival instincts (better Prowess)
    
- **Grief** opens access to forgotten memories or ancestral power
    
- **Rage** increases energy throughput—higher output, higher burnout risk
    
- **Love** stabilizes and harmonizes energy use (lower burnout risk)
    

Could lead to a doctrine known as **The Emotional Code**, passed down in specific schools or cults.
